# Notes
notes: |
  SAIIT is a 2AFC task measuring selective attention and response inhibition.
  Participants respond to targets on left or right side while ignoring distractors.

  Key experimental manipulations:
  - Stimulus side (left vs right)
  - Response accuracy (correct vs incorrect)
  - Reaction time (fast vs slow)

  Common analyses:
  - ERP differences between correct and incorrect trials
  - RT effects on P3 amplitude
  - Lateralized readiness potentials (LRP)
