## Archived Files

### analysis.py
- **Status**: Empty placeholder
- **Reason**: Never implemented, functionality moved to future Features/Results pages

### hpc.py
- **Status**: Incomplete HPC job submission interface
- **Reason**: Batch processing handled via CLI/scripts, not needed in UI

### pipeline.py
- **Status**: Pipeline visualization (unused)
- **Reason**: Pipeline visualization integrated into home page progress tracking

### project.py
- **Status**: Duplicate project management
- **Reason**: Project management already in `app.py` home page

### results.py
- **Status**: Empty placeholder
- **Reason**: Never implemented, future Results/Prediction page will be created

## Future Plans

Some functionality from these pages may be reimplemented in Phase 2+ of the UI redesign:

1. **Results Visualization** - Will be implemented as `9_results.py` in Phase 3
2. **HPC Integration** - May be added as export functionality in batch preprocessing
3. **Pipeline Visualization** - Already integrated into home page progress tracking

## Restoration

If you need to restore any of these pages, they are preserved in this directory and can be moved back to the parent `pages/` folder. However, they will need to be updated to match the new stage-based navigation structure.
